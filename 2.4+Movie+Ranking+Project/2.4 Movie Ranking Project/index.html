<h2>My best 3 movies.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Inception (2010) - Directed by Christopher Nolan</h3>
<p>
    I love "Inception" for its complex narrative structure, mind-bending concept, and exceptional 
    execution. The film delves into the depths of the subconscious mind, exploring themes of reality, 
    dreams, and perception. The visual effects are stunning, especially the scenes that defy gravity 
    and physics.

<h3>The Shawshank Redemption (1994) - Directed by Frank Darabont</h3>
<p>
    The film tells the story of hope, resilience, and the human spirit through the experiences of Andy 
    Dufresne, a wrongly convicted man, and his friendship with fellow inmate Red. The narrative is 
    beautifully crafted, with rich character development and poignant moments that tug at the 
    heartstrings.

<h3>The Lord of the Rings Trilogy (2001-2003) - Directed by Peter Jackson</h3>
<p>
    The scale and scope of the story, coupled with breathtaking visuals and groundbreaking special 
    effects, make "The Lord of the Rings" an unforgettable cinematic experience. Beyond the epic battles 
    and fantastical landscapes, the heart of the trilogy lies in its characters and their journey of 
    courage, friendship, and sacrifice.
